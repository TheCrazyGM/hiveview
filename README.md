# hiveview
Django App for viewing/interacting with Hive Blockchain
The idea is to have a django app for the routes and necesary stuff to include into larger projects

Used the simple blog app from [Django Girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/)) as a base django template.

Used an unholy mix of steem and bhive (as some stuff is just broken in bhive at the moment)

# Done

@username routes including @username/post (but not replies, followers, followees)
all /tag/@username/post
/trending, /hot, /created, 

detailed view is mostly complete, including replies
detailed view shows number of votes and current payout value
posts are markdown rendered
