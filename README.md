# hiveview
Django App for viewing/interacting with Steem Blockchain

Used the simple blog app from [Django Girls](https://tutorial.djangogirls.org/)) as a base django template.

Used an unholy mix of steempy and beem (as some stuff is just broken in beem at the moment)

# Done
@username routes including @username/post (but not replies, followers, followees)
all /tag/@username/post
/trending, /hot, /created, 

detailed view is mostly complete, including replies
detailed view shows number of votes and current payout value
posts are markdown rendered
